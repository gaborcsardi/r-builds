# r-builds

This repository orchestrates tools to produce R binaries obtainable from:
https://cdn.rstudio.com/r. The binaries are available as a
community resource, **they are not professionally supported by RStudio**. 
The R language is open source, please see the official documentation at https://www.r-project.org/.

These binaries are not a replacement to existing binary distributions for R.
The binaries were built with the following considerations:
- They use a minimal, documented set of
  [build](https://github.com/rstudio/r-builds/tree/master/builder) and
  [runtime](https://github.com/rstudio/r-docker) dependencies.  
- They are designed to be used side-by-side, e.g., on [RStudio Server Pro](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/r-versions.html#using-multiple-versions-of-r-concurrently).
- They give users a consistent option for accessing R across different Linux distributions.

These binaries have been extensively tested, and are used in production everyday
on [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and
[shinyapps.io](https://shinyapps.io). Please open an issue to report a specific
bug, and address questions on [RStudio
Community](https://community.rstudio.com).

## Example Usage

These binaries are designed to be copied onto a server, as opposed to installed
using a system package manager like `apt` or `yum`. This approach allows administrators
to offer multiple versions of R side-by-side. 

```bash
# Install runtime pre-reqs
# Then copy the desired R version from the CDN

OS_IDENTIFIER=ubuntu-1804
R_VERSION=3.5.3

wget -O R-${R_VERSION}.tar.gz https://cdn.rstudio.com/r/${OS_IDENTIFIER}/R-${R_VERSION}-${OS_IDENTIFIER}.tar.gz 
mkdir -p /opt/R 
tar zx -C /opt/R -f ./R-${R_VERSION}.tar.gz 
rm R-${R_VERSION}.tar.gz

# execute R from this directory
/opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/R -e 'capabilities()'

# optionally add this version to the path
PATH=/opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin:${PATH}

# OR optionally link the binaries to /usr
ln -s /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/R /usr/bin/R 
ln -s /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/bin/Rscript /usr/bin/Rscript
ln -s /opt/R/${R_VERSION}/lib/R /usr/lib/R 
```
The R binary can be obtain from the CDN using a URL with the format:  

```
https://cdn.rstudio.com/r/<OS_IDENTIFIER>/R-<R_VERSION>-<OS_IDENTIFIER>.tar.gz
```

The list of currently available R versions can be obtained here:
https://cdn.rstudio.com/r/versions.json.  

The following operating systems are supported:  

|Operating System|OS Identifier| 
|---|---|
|CentOS 6|centos-6|
|CentOS 7|centos-7|
|Debian 9|debian-9|
|OpenSUSE 15.1|opensuse-15|
|OpenSUSE 42.3|opensuse-42|
|Ubuntu 16.04 Xenial|ubuntu-1604|
|Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic|ubuntu-1804|

The R binaries are built on these open source containers, but have been tested
on their commerical equivalents. For example, the CentOS binaries also work on
RedHat Enterprise Linux (REHL) and the OpenSUSE binaries also work on SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server (SLES).

Please see [r-docker](https://github.com/rstudio/r-docker) and
[r-system-requirements](https://github.com/rstudio/r-system-requirements) for
more information on using these binaries. The `r-docker` repository documents
required runtime system dependencies and provides users with docker images
containing these dependencies. The `r-system-requirements` repository contains
information on the additional system dependencies that may be required to
install and use R packages.

# Developer Documentation

This repository orchestrates builds using a variety of tools. The
instructions below outline the components in the stack and describe how to add a
new platform or inspect an existing platform.

## Adding a new platform.

### Dockerfile

Create a `builder/Dockerfile.platform-version` (where `platform-version` is `ubuntu-1604` or `centos-74`, etc.) This file must contain four major tasks:

1. an `OS_IDENTIFIER` env with the `platform-version`.
2. a step which ensures the R source build dependencies are installed
3. The `awscli`, most likely installed via `pip` for uploading tarballs to S3
4. `COPY` and `ENTRYPOINT` for the `build.sh` file in `builder/`.

### docker-compose.yml

A new service in the docker-compose file named according to the `platform-version` and containing the proper entries:

```
command: ./build.sh
environment:
  - R_VERSION=${R_VERSION} # for testing out R builds locally
  - LOCAL_STORE=/tmp/output # ensures that output tarballs are persisted locally
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile.debian-9
image: r-builds:debian-9
volumes:
  - ./integration/tmp:/tmp/output  # path to output tarballs
```

### Job definition

IN `serverless-resources.yml` you'll need to add a job definition that points to the ECR image.

```
rBuildsBatchJobDefinitionDebian9:
  Type: AWS::Batch::JobDefinition
  Properties:
    Type: container
    ContainerProperties:
      Command:
        - ./build.sh
      Vcpus: 4
      Memory: 4096
      JobRoleArn:
        "Fn::GetAtt": [ rBuildsEcsTaskIamRole, Arn ]
      Image: #{AWS::AccountId}.dkr.ecr.#{AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com/r-builds:debian-9
```

### Environment variables in the serverless.yml functions.

The serverless functions which trigger R builds need to be informed of new platforms.

1. Add a `JOB_DEFINITION_ARN_PlatformVersion` env variable with a ref to the Job definition above.
2. Append the `platform-version` to `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS`.

```
environment:
  # snip
  JOB_DEFINITION_ARN_debian_9:
    Ref: rBuildsBatchJobDefinitionDebian9
  SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS: ubuntu-1604,ubuntu-1804,debian-9
```

### Makefile

In order for the makefile to push these new platforms to ECR, add them to the PLATFORMS variable near the top of the Makefile

### Submit a Pull Request

Once you've followed the steps above, submit a pull request. On successful merge, builds for this platform will begin to be available from the CDN.

## "Break Glass"

Periodically, someone with access to these resources may need to re-trigger every R version/platform combination. This quite easy with the `serverless` tool installed.

```
serverless invoke stepf -n rBuilds -d '{"force": true}'
```
